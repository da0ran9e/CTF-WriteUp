2. Lets Warm Up
    - If I told you a word started with 0x70 in hexadecimal, what would it start with in ASCII?

3. Warmed Up
    - What is 0x3D (base 16) in decimal (base 10)?
    - Flag: `picoCTF{61}`

4. Bases
    - Description: What does this `bDNhcm5fdGgzX3IwcDM1` mean? I think it has something to do with bases. 
    
    - Base64 
    - Flag: `Flag: picoCTF{l3arn_th3_r0p35}`

5. First Grep

    - Can you find the flag in [file]()? This would be really tedious to look through manually, something tells me there is a better way.
    
    ``` shell
    strings file | grep "pico"
    ```
    - Flag: 'picoCTF{grep_is_good_to_find_things_5f0c3d9e}'
